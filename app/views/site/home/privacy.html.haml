  %h3 About Spot and the Information We Collect

  %h4 Profile Information submitted by Members to Spot

  %p Spot is an online community that connects people through the places they visit and helps them discover places around them.. To accomplish this, each Spot Member creates his or her own profile, which contains a list of places relevant to the member. This personal information includes such things as:

  %ul
    %li First name or first and last names of the Member (depending on the options selected by the Member),
    %li Location (e.g., city and state), and
    %li Photos, videos or other shared content uploaded by the Member to his or her profile, to the extent that it includes personal information.

  %h4 Other Information submitted by Members to Spot

  %p Spot also collects Member-submitted account information such as name and email address to identify Members, send notifications related to the use of the Spot service and conduct market research and marketing for Spot's internal use only.

  %h4 Information Not Directly Submitted by Members or Other Website Users to Spot

  %p Finally, we may also collect some information from Members, as well as from other visitors to the Spot website, that is not personally identifiable, such as browser type and IP address. This information is gathered from all Members and visitors to the website.

  %h3 Use of Information Obtained by Spot

  %h4 Display of Members' Information

  %p Except where a Member might choose to include a full name in his or her profile, a Member's email address and full name will only be used in the following circumstances:

  %ul
    %li When the Member invites a friend via email to become a Spot Member,
    %li When the Member sends a request to another Member to add the other Member to his or her friend list,
    %li When we send notifications to the Member relating to his or her use of the Spot service or Spot website, and
    %li If the Member so chooses, when we send regular notifications, weekly updates, or other news regarding the Spot service or the Spot website.

  %p Except when inviting or adding friends or as otherwise expressly set forth herein, a Member's email address will never be shared with or displayed to any other person. Members and their friends, and other Members within their personal networks (depending on the level of sharing a Member has chosen) communicate on Spot with each other through the Spot service, without disclosing email addresses.

  %h3 Spot's Use of Members' Information

  %p We use information relating to each Member's server information, IP address, and browser-type.

  %h4 Sharing of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks

  %p Except as explained herein, or where you are expressly informed otherwise, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information unless required by law or for the protection of your Membership. However, Spot may share profile information and aggregate usage information in a non-personally identifiable manner with advertisers and other third parties in order to present to Members and other users of the Spot website more targeted advertising, products and services; provided that, in such situations, we will never disclose information that would personally identify you. As set forth above, Spot may (i) use your email address to conduct market research for Spot's internal use only; and/or (ii) use your email address to market Spot to you (e.g., new features and applications, announcements, opportunities of interest). Spot may contract with a third party to conduct such research and marketing; provided that such third party will be fully bound by an obligation of confidentiality to Spot and may not use any personally-identifiable information provided by Spot other than as expressly instructed by Spot and in strict compliance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

  %h4 Links
  %p The Spot Website contains links to other websites. This includes links that are placed there by Spot (such as in advertisements), as well as by other Spot Members. Please be aware that Spot is not responsible for the privacy practices of any other website. We encourage all Members and other users of the Spot website to be aware of when they leave our website, and to read the privacy policies of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by Spot through the Spot website.

  %h4 Use of Cookies

  %p A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on the Spot website. However, we do not and will not use cookies to collect private information from any Member or other user of the Spot website which they did not intentionally submit to us other than as stated in this Privacy Policy. We use both "session ID cookies" and "persistent cookies." We use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Note also that Members may optionally use a cookie to remember their email in order to automatically log in to our website. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browsers's "help" file; however, please note that, if you reject cookies or disable cookies in your web browser, you may not be able to use the Spot website.

  %h4 Changes in Our Privacy Policy

  %p If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our web site so Members and other users of the Spot website are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we are going to use Members' or other users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify those Members and users via email or by placing a prominent notice on our website.

  %h4 Invite a Friend

  %p 
    If a Member elects to use our "Invite" feature to invite a friend to become a Member of the Spot service, we ask them for that friend's email address. Spot will automatically send the friend an email inviting them to join the site. Spot stores this email address for the purpose of: (i) automatically adding the respondent to the “friends list” of the Member sending the invitation; (ii) sending reminders of the invitation and (iii) sending emails on recent updates by the Member on Spot to the Member's invited friend. Spot will never sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders. Any person who receives an invitation may 
    =mail_to "support@spotmembers.com", "contact Spot" 
    to request the  removal of this information from our database.

  %h4 Security

  %p 
    The Spot account of every Member is password-protected. Spot takes every precaution to protect the information of the Members, as well as information collected from other users of the Spot website. We use industry standard measures to protect all information that is stored on our servers and within our database. We limit the access to this information to those employees who need access to perform their job function such as our customer service personnel. If you have any questions about the security at our website, please 
    =mail_to "support@spotmembers.com", "contact us"

  %h4 Email Choice/Opt-out

  %p Members who no longer wish to receive our weekly email updates or other email notifications may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the instructions contained in the applicable email or by logging-in and changing their settings in the "Account Settings" section of the Spot website. You can access this page by clicking on the "Settings" link on the top right of your Spot homepage.

  %h4 Third Party Advertising

  %p The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to Members by our Web advertising partners. Our Web advertising partners may use cookies. Doing this allows the ad network to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. Spot does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed on the computer of any Member or other user of the Spot website by the third-party ad servers or ad networks.

  %p This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Spot only, and does not cover the use of cookies by any other party.
