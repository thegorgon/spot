    question: What is a "deal"?
    name: dealdef
    answer:
      A deal is a discount valid for a certain time period. 
      Use deals to attract visitors on days when your business is typically slower. 
      You have control over the number of discounts to issue, the times when your 
      discount should be valid, and the size of the discount to offer. 
      You can also make your deal more attractive by adding a colorful editorial 
      description of your deal.

    question: How does the redemption process work?
    name: redemptionprocess
    answer:
      Discount codes are automatically generated for each deal that you set up. A list of codes
      will be emailed to you each day that you have a deal running. You can also find a list of 
      codes for any specific date by logging in to your Spot account. Each customer is issued 
      a unique code that must be redeemed in order to receive a discount. When a customer presents 
      their code, you need to cross check with your own list of codes. Once a code has been redeemed, 
      make a note so that it cannot be used again.
