    question: What is a "deal"?
    name: dealdef
    answer:
      A deal is a discount valid for a certain time period. 
      Use deals to attract visitors on days when your business is typically slower. 
      You have control over the number of discounts to issue, the times when your 
      discount should be valid, and the size of the discount to offer. 
      You can also make your deal more attractive by adding a colorful editorial 
      description of your deal.
